## reddit-oauth2

A collection of functions for interacting with the [Reddit OAuth2 API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api).
It's enough to write a simple bot with, though.

I only plan to release this on Hackage when this is at least semi-complete.
Documentation for this package can be found at https://penelopeysm.github.io/reddit-oauth2/Reddit.html.

Further documentation of the API is available at https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki.

There is an existing Haskell [reddit library](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/reddit), but it's not been actively maintained since at least 2018 and doesn't support OAuth2 (which, [according to Reddit](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/API), is compulsory).
